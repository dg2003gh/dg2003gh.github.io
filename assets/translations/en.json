  "long-history-text": "<p>My name is Douglas Guimar√£es, I'm 20 years old, a FullStack programmer, and I'm majoring in Information Systems. I'll tell you a brief story that encapsulates my LOVE for programming. Did I always want to pursue this area? The answer is no. As a child, I wanted to be a firefighter. Curious, isn't it? A completely different profession from what I am today and deeply passionate about. This happened around 2018 or even before. My mom bought a beaten-up laptop from a used store. No battery, just a USB drive. That USB drive would change my life because it contained a Linux distribution called BigLinux. Back then, I didn't even know there was a world of open-source and free software outside of Windows. To me, it was just that, but it wasn't. There was so much more, a whole new world to explore: fascinating ideas, completely captivating concepts, and... it all ended when I tried to use a different power source for the laptop, and it burned out. But that's okay... I suppose. Because the story doesn't end here, years later, my dad bought a brand new laptop straight from the store. I was ecstatic, while my dad was... how parents get when they buy something expensive. Anyway, it was there. A new and beautiful laptop. A quarter of it went to the Windows license, until... the hard drive burned out, and, being the idiot that I am, I decided to open it, thus voiding the warranty. However, let's not jump to conclusions because I couldn't fix it... My dad certainly won't be happy with this information that I just made public. Sorry, Dad. The important thing is: do you remember that USB drive with a Linux distribution? I still have it to this day, and back then, it was much needed. I used the laptop with various live distributions for about two years until I could afford to buy a hard drive with my mom. And after I met Linux, I never left it. Well, I confess, maybe in my second year of high school because I wanted to play Roblox with my friend. But after a week, I came back and never left. And so, after getting to know Linux and interacting with its community and having to use it and learn to live with a 3.5GB temporary hard drive, I decided that this was my path from then on. And today, here I am, aspiring to be a respected Fullstack developer, knowing that a kid who wanted to be a firefighter became a passionate developer, thanks to a technology and two people who are my life.</p>",
