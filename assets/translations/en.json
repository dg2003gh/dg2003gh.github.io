I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems at Est√°cio de S√°.</p><p>My passion for programming began at 16, and over the past two years, I‚Äôve worked as a freelancer, sharpening my skills as a Fullstack developer. My projects span from 3D modeling to mobile apps‚Äîcheck out the 'Skills' section for the technologies I use.</p><p>I'm also active in the open-source community, having contributed to and created several projects.

  "long-history-text": "<p>Hey, I‚Äôm Douglas Guimar√£es‚Äî22, Fullstack developer, and currently studying Information Systems. Let me tell you how I fell in love with tech. Did I always dream of coding? Not at all. As a kid, I wanted to be a firefighter‚Äîtotally different from where I ended up. But in 2018, everything changed when my mom bought a used laptop with no battery, just a USB stick. That USB had a Linux distro called BigLinux. At the time, I didn‚Äôt even know open-source existed. That laptop opened a whole new world for me‚Äîuntil I fried it by plugging in the wrong charger.</p><p>Years later, my dad bought a brand new laptop. I was over the moon... until the hard drive died. I voided the warranty trying to fix it (sorry, Dad üòÖ). Thankfully, I still had that USB drive. I ran various Linux distros off of it for nearly two years before finally buying a hard drive with my mom. Since then, Linux and I have been inseparable‚Äîexcept for that one week in high school when I installed Windows just to play Roblox. But I came back!</p><p>Living with Linux taught me resourcefulness, and the community inspired me to keep going. That‚Äôs when I realized: this is what I want to do with my life. And today, that curious kid who once wanted to fight fires is building software and chasing the dream of becoming a respected Fullstack developer‚Äîthanks to technology, and two incredible people in my life.</p>",
