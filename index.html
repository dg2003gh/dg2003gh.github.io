            <p>
              My name is Douglas Guimarães, I'm from Brazil and I'm 20 years
              old. It all started when I was 14 or 15 years old and my mother
              bought me an older laptop that came with an old version of a Linux
              distribution called BigLinux. Initially, I tried to install
              Windows on it, but this laptop didn't even have a hard drive, so I
              ended up booting BigLinux from a USB stick. While trying to remove
              it from the USB stick and install it on my old laptop, I
              discovered Diolinux (a Brazilian YouTuber) and others who helped
              me understand Linux.
            </p>
            <p>
              After my laptop broke, I didn't hear about Linux for a long time.
              I had other computers, but they all had Windows, and I only used
              them for basic tasks. In 2019, I received a new laptop from my
              father, and I was so happy about it... until the hard drive burned
              out. Instead of telling my father and calling for maintenance, I
              decided to open it up and try to fix it myself. Did I fix it? Of
              course not! I admit that I can be a bit clueless sometimes. The
              only way to keep using it was to install Linux, so I installed
              Linux Mint.
            </p>
            <p>
              This experience made Linux so much more interesting to me. I
              wanted to enter the beautiful world of technology from a
              developer's point of view - to learn how to make things instead of
              just using them. I learned Python, JavaScript, Node.js, Bash, and
              more. Of course, you don't have to be a developer to use Linux,
              but using Linux and wanting to learn more about it made me who I
              am today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I aspire to be a full-stack developer. I'm a volunteer
              for the BigLinux distribution (yes, the first distribution I used
              knowing that it was Linux), and I'm studying information
              technology while working as a freelancer. You can contact me in
              the "Contact Me" section and see my skills in the "Skills"
              section.
